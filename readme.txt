    Description
        Project 3 is the 2nd pass of an assembler in SIC/XE used to calculate memory addresses for 
        instructions and data. It utilizes pass 1 which stores labels and addresses in a symbol table.
        It outputs a set of records which define instructions for example, T for executable records, and H
        for headers.
